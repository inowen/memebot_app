To open on a new machine with Android Studio:
 - clone the repository
 - go into app/build.gradle
 - Change all the references to "targetSdkVersion" to whatever the version on that machine is (create a new project and look at its app/build.gradle file, copy the target version from there). 

 - File -> Sync Gradle Files
