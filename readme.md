This project will be on the Android app store. Before that, I have to add settings, make the image scroll view a fullscreen view, make sure there's no conflicting licence on any of the images used, remove the ugly overhead bar with the name of the app on it, finish the Favorites feature, change the suggestions, and get a more neutral background image.

## To open on a new machine with Android Studio:

 - clone the repository and open it with Android Studio
 - go into app/build.gradle
 - Change all the references to "targetSdkVersion" to whatever the version on that machine is (create a new project and look at its app/build.gradle file, copy the target version from there). 
 - In Android Studio: File -> Sync Gradle Files
